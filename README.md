<h1> <b> üî¨ Sweet2Plus üî¨ </b> </h1> 
A python API for analysis of suite2P outputs. In addition to parsing suite2P outputs, this repo includes various statistical analyses in python and R. This repo also contains a reliable neural network (MLP) üß† for signal classification. 
We include scripts allowing for easy plug in of DeepLabCut based pose-estimation results. This repository contains C++ code for running behavioral experiments in the wet lab, as well as a guided user interface for managing multiple ports
from various behavioral computers simultaneously.

<h2> <b> Sweet2Plus's API </b></h2>
Sweet2Plus allows for the analysis of two-photon calcium imaging data. Here are a few example images from our dataset:

</p>

Although there is more to come, we utalize code to functionally define neuronal cell types and then perform analyses based on these cell types.

<h2> <b> Example Neural Network Classifier Performance </b></h2>
We trained a Pytorch based Neural Network (multi-layer perceptron) to parse Suite2P suggested regions of interest (ROIs) into real vs not-real signal. In addition to training, our model was enhanced through Optuna (bayesian optimization) hyper-parameter tuning. 

First, traces are read into python and normalized to a pre-determined number of points.

</p>

Overall, the classifier performed moderatly well with a test F1 score >0.82:

</p>

The classifier was optimized via Bayesian Optimization available with the Optuna library:

</p>

Now, we quickly use this classifier to parse real from not-real ROIs suggested by Suite2P. Notably, not-real ROIs include ROIs containing no-signal or extremly low signal with S:N < 3:1.
