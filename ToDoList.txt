Running to do list:
(1) Analysis of manifolds via euclidean distances across trial types. 

(2) Analysis of general neuronal activity across conditions
    (a) Need to generate regression statistics
        (i) fdr post hoc corrections or remove nonsensical comparisons... How to do this????
        (ii) Use EMM not just observed averages of data 
        (iii) finding best model with AIC values
    (b) Generate comprehensive graph containing heatmaps

(3) Activity of cluster results 
    (a) Double check reliability of silhouette scores

(4) Weight modeling analysis
    (a) Finish code for collecting weights and saving to a csv dataframe
        Need to save weight and bias dataframe, correlation of activity, pseudo_data?
    (b) Finish code that runs hypertuning for all s2p obj files. 
        Need to save json file containing best hyperparameters and the best correlation result
        (i) calculates the best hyperparameters via median and graphs the hyperparameters wrt the best correlation
            Saves median of best hyperparameters to json file in communal directory
    (c) Run all s2p objects using best hyperparameters and saving weight dataframes
        Need to add in hyperparameters as a cli setting
    (d) Write code to analyze changes in weight distributions over conditions in dataframe 
        (i) Graph kernel distributions of weights and biases wrt experimental conditions
        (ii) Graph average +/- sem of weights and biases wrt experimental conditions
        (iii) Possibly seperate neuron's influence on itself into two subsets because this data might bias the results. 
        (iv) Cluster neuron's by weight distributions and then look at their activity? 
    (e) Run all on cluster

(5) Finding missing data
    (a) 99 recording folders, yet only 88 obj*.json files
