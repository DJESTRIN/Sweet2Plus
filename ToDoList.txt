Running to do list:
(1) How to determine neurons across recording sessions?
(2) Analyze euclidian distance of state between trial types and sessions
(3) How do manifold state differ within session ....
    How do these state changes differ across sessions
    NEED: Euclidian distance

Raster plots
    Average all neurons:
        - seperate data into cort and control

    Average per cell type:
        - Double check y axis compared to above plots
        - Double check average compared to above plots
        - Put heatmap above average +/- sem plots
