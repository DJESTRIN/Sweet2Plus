Running to do list:
(1) How to determine neurons across recording sessions?
(2) Analyze euclidian distance of state between trial types and sessions
(3) How do manifold state differ within session ....
    How do these state changes differ across sessions
    NEED: Euclidian distance

Raster plots
    Average all neurons:
        - seperate data into cort and control

    Average per cell type:
        - Double check y axis compared to above plots
        - Double check average compared to above plots
        - Put heatmap above average +/- sem plots 
    
Cluster code:
    Are silhouette coeffiencts indicating that there are definite clusters. 

Are we using DF/F or normalized DF (de-bleached) and should we change it?


There are 99 Recording folders, but only 88 obj*.json files for the final analysis. We need to figure out why.

02/24/2025 notes
- Add heatmaps to plot. how should it be organized? for all trials
- individual neuron auc graphs...
- Remove -15 to -10 data from graphs... 
- Run glm or lm and talk with kenneth about organization ... 
- clean up current graphs for activity by group by day 


Notes on modeling:

glm or lmm 
fdr post hoc correction of t tests alpha = 0.05
or 
looking into removing or reducing weight of nonsensical comparisons in t -test multiple comparisons. 

Activity = Group*Session*Trialtype + Group*Session + Group*Trialtype + Session*Trialtype + Group + Session + Trialtype + (1/(Subject/Neuron))
Activity = Group*Session*Trialtype + Group*Session + Group*Trialtype + Session*Trialtype + Group + Session + Trialtype + (1/(Subject/Neuron/TrialNumber))
Activity = Group*Session*Trialtype*BaselineVsEvent + Group*Session*BaselineVsEvent + Group*Trialtype + Session*Trialtype + Group + Session + Trialtype + (1/(Subject/Neuron))
