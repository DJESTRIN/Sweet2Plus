"""
Compare correlation of acitivty:
(1) whole dataset for all animals across time (1,7,14)
    Get average correlation across each neuron in mouse. Then get average +/- sem correlation across mice. 
    GLM or LMM for all neurons average correlation for all mice -> put into dataframe for SAS?
(2) TMT vs non-TMT subgroups 
    Correlate TMT vs TMT neurons, Non-TMT vs Non TMT, TMT vs all and Non TMT vs all. Do this averaged across mice and across time. 
(3) Analyze pre TMT and post TMT Day 1 recordings to see changes in state?
    N dimensions for N neurons where each dimension is average AUC. 
    Does the state change differ with respect to stress (Day 1 vs Day 14)

 # Look at correlation of activity during baseline
        # Look at correlation of activity during US
        # Look at correlation of activity during post-TMT
        # Get PETHS and classify neurons by activity
        # Look at each of above correlations with respect to functional classification of neurons
